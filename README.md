# ArtExplorerBot
ArtExplorerBot is my diploma project for the Data Scientist qualification. This sophisticated system represents an end-to-end multimodal AI solution designed to analyze and interpret artwork. It combines computer vision and natural language processing to provide deep insights into paintings, including their origin, style, emotional impact, and contextual meaning.

The bot processes artwork through a pipeline of specialized models, with final synthesis handled by the GigaChat API to deliver coherent and engaging art analysis.

## Project Significance
As a diploma project, ArtExplorerBot demonstrates comprehensive mastery of:

* Multimodal AI system architecture
* Model fine-tuning and transfer learning
* API integration and pipeline orchestration
* Computer Vision (image classification)
* Natural Language Processing (captioning and text generation)

## Model Architecture
The analysis pipeline consists of four specialized ML models:

1. Artwork Origin Verification
Model: Fine-tuned MobileNet
Purpose: Determines whether the artwork was created by a human or generated by AI

2. Style and Emotion Classification
Model: Fine-tuned MobileNet
Purpose: Predicts the artistic style and dominant emotions evoked by the piece

3. General Description Generation
Model: Original BLIP model
Purpose: Generates a comprehensive visual description of the artwork

4. Emotional Description Generation
Model: Fine-tuned BLIP model
Purpose: Creates descriptions focusing specifically on emotional content and atmosphere
